k Distinct Integers With Target Sum
-----------------------------------

The goal of this question is to produce, in Python,
an algorithm that given a list of integers prints k distinct integers that
form the target sum.

The input is a text file that should be read by your program, and has the
following format:

3
51
7
3
6
10
43
54
2

where the first line in the file is k, the second line is the target sum,
and the rest of the lines are the potential integers to be summed.

In the above example, your program should find the 3 numbers:

6
43
2

because they are distinct and add up to 51. The order of the numbers found is
irrelevant.

This question has two parts:

1. Implement a brute-force solution. What's the running time of this solution,
   as a function of n and k, where n in the length of the input set?

2. Implement a more time efficient solution - ideally a solution with lowest
   possible running time. What's the running time of your solution? Do you
   think it's possible to do better? Why or why not?
